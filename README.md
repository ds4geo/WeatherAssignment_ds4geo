# WeatherAssignment_ds4geo

This is an assignemnt from the Data Science for Geologist course. 

### Task

Create a Jupyter notebook where you tell the story of what it is like to live in 2 different cities in terms of the weather. Pick 2 from Innsbruck, London, Sydney, Tehran and Singapore.

Daily weather data for these cities for 2015 to 2019 is provided (see below).
You should not use any source of information (including personal experience) other than the data provided and your analysis of it.
You are free to tell the story as you wish in terms of content and style. Your audience is the other course participants.
Do not just summarise the data, tell a story. You do not need to use all of the available data.
Length depends on how one tells the story, but including 10 lines of code is too short, and 100 is too long.
Use Pandas to handle and analyse the data. Use the built in help, online Pandas help docs, and google to figure out how to perform your analysis. Note down anything you wish to do but cannot figure out how to do.
